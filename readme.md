# Introduction to SQL and Databases
## A brief overview of entity relationships and simple SQL statements

This lecture details data types, tables, table relationships, and an introduction to Structured Query Language. We will utilize [GitHub](http://github.com) to obtain our course materials and [repl.it](http://repl.it) to practice our queries.

**Topics covered**
* Data tables
    * Introduction to data types
    * Overview of entity relationships
* Defining Structured Query Language (SQL)
    * Reading code
    * Types of statements
    * "How to develop business questions"
    * Introduction to queries

**Pre-requisites**
* An interest in learning about databases and Structured Query Language
* Read this how-to for [forking GitHub repositories](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) this will be how you obtain the course materials

**Required e-learning materials**
1. Internet connection
2. [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) - a meeting ID will be given prior to the class
3. A [GitHub](http://github.com) account
4. A [repl.it](http://repl.it) account connected to GitHub

**Additional resources**
1. Learning to create ER-Diagrams:
  	- [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home) - Creating ER-Diagrams that can be used to outline database architecture
2. Practicing SQL statements:
    - [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/) - A great resource for practicing in-browser querying
3. Creating tables:
    - [repl.it](https://repl.it/) - The sqlite3 support allows in-browser table creation and query practice. The base examples for "Querying against tables" are a great starting point.
4. Reference:
		- [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) - This resource provides an index of all SQL commands and basic definitions (with examples!).
